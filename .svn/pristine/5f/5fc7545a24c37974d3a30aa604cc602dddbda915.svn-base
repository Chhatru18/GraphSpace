GraphSpace
    1. Database setup with SQLAlchemy
        - Might change over to Django ORM later on. But currently there is no issue.
        - Eventually might have to migrate all data from old db to new db.

    2. Cytoscape Web for displaying graphs
        - Generate popup dialog when the user clicks on nodes/edges if popup data are available

    3. Graph JSON object
        - All dada are already on the database. There is no additional data being inserted to the JSON object.
