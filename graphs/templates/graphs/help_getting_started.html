<h1>Welcome to GraphSpace!</h1>

<b>This page should help familiarize you with GraphSpace's interface and basic features.</b>

<br/>
<br/>
<h4>What is a graph?</h4>

A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)">graph</a> is a mathematical object containing vertices (also known as nodes or points) and edges which connect the vertices.

<br/>

Graphs are used to represent many different things such as computer networks, biological pathways, and many more.

<br/>

GraphSpace allows people to store and share graphs, regardless of what those graphs represent.


<ul>
<li><a href="#view">I want to find and view graphs that are shared with me</a>
<li><a href="#upload">I want to upload graphs</a>
<li><a href="#sharing">I want to share my graphs</a>
</ul>

<h3 id="view">Finding and viewing graphs</h3>

Notice the bar at the top of the screen. On the left hand side, right next to the big "GraphSpace" logo, are links to your graphs and groups.

<br/>

On your graphs page, you will see buttons at the top of the page called "My Graphs", "Shared with me" and "Public graphs".

<ul>

<li><b><a href="{{url}}graphs/">My Graphs</a></b> will show graphs that you own (you have uploaded).</li>

<li><b><a href="{{url}}graphs/shared/">Shared with me</a></b> will show graphs that have been shared with you through groups.</li>

<li><b><a href="{{url}}graphs/public/">Public Graphs</a></b> will show graphs that have been made publicly available on GraphSpace.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="view">Grouping Graphs</h3>

You can also look at groups, which are collections of graphs shared by members of the group. Click on groups in the navigation bar. You should see the following categories for groups

<ul>

<li><b><a href="{{url}}groups/">Owner of</a></b> are groups that you have created and are the owner of. You can set the description of groups that you own as well as add or remove members. All other functionality is accomplished through the <a href="{{url}}help/restapi/#groups">REST API</a></li>

<li><b><a href="{{url}}groups/member/">Members of</a></b> are groups that you have been added to. You can view or add graphs to these groups through the <a href="{{url}}help/restapi/#graphs">REST API</a></li>

</ul>
