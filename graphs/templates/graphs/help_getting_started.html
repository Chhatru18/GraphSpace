<h1>Welcome to GraphSpace!</h1>

<b>This page should help familiarize you with GraphSpace's interface and basic features.</b>

<br/>
<br/>
<h4>What is a graph?</h4>

A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)">graph</a> is a mathematical object containing vertices (also known as nodes or points) and edges which connect the vertices.

<br/>

Graphs are used to represent many different things such as computer networks, biological pathways, and many more.

<br/>

GraphSpace allows people to store and share graphs, regardless of what those graphs represent.


<ul>
<li><a href="#view">I want to find and view graphs that are shared with me</a>
<li><a href="#upload">I want to upload graphs</a>
<li><a href="#sharing">I want to share my graphs</a>
</ul>

<h3 id="view">Finding and viewing graphs</h3>

Notice the bar at the top of the screen. On the left hand side, right next to the big "GraphSpace" logo, are links to your graphs and groups.

<br/>

On your graphs page, you will see buttons at the top of the page called "My Graphs", "Shared with me" and "Public graphs".

<ul>

<li><b><a href="{{url}}graphs/">My Graphs</a></b> will show graphs that you own (you have uploaded).</li>

<li><b><a href="{{url}}graphs/shared/">Shared with me</a></b> will show graphs that have been shared with you through groups.</li>

<li><b><a href="{{url}}graphs/public/">Public Graphs</a></b> will show graphs that have been made publicly available on GraphSpace.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="view">Grouping Graphs</h3>

You can also look at groups, which are collections of graphs shared by members of the group. Click on groups in the navigation bar. You should see the following categories for groups

<ul>

<li><b><a href="{{url}}groups/">Owner of</a></b> are groups that you have created and are the owner of. You can set the description of groups that you own as well as add or remove members. All other functionality is accomplished through the <a href="{{url}}help/restapi/#groups">REST API</a></li>

<li><b><a href="{{url}}groups/member/">Members of</a></b> are groups that you have been added to. You can view or add graphs to these groups through the <a href="{{url}}help/restapi/#graphs">REST API</a></li>

</ul>


<h3 id="upload">Uploading graphs</h3>

GraphSpace represents graphs using a JSON format. To see an example of how to uplaod a correctly formatted JSON graph to GraphSpace, please see <a href="{{url}}help/restapi/#add_graph">this page</a>.

<h3 id="sharing">Sharing graphs</h3>
{% with url|add:"help/restapi/" as final_url %}
    To share one of your graphs, refer to the <a href='{{final_url}}'>REST API</a>.
{% endwith %}
<br>
In order to share a graph, you must own the graph.  In addition, you must be a member or the owner of the group you want to share the graph with.  Sharing a graph allows all the members in the group to see the graph.  Un-sharing a graph means that no one in the group is allowed to see that graph anymore.  Only the graph owner is allowed to see the graph. 

<h3 id="layouts">Layouts</h3>
A layout is a specific representation of the network.  In terms of GraphSpace, a layout is the specific arrangement of nodes and edges for that graph.  GraphSpace provides a list of pre-defined algorithms to quickly layout any graph.  In addition, a user can also manually go in and arrange nodes and edges as they see fit and then save the layout for future reference.  

<h3 id="sharing_layouts">Sharing layouts</h3>
Similar to a graph, a layout may also be shared with a group.  In order for a layout to be shared with a group, the graph (and implicitly the graph owner) must already be shared with a group.  It would make no sense to share a layout with a group if that graph may not be viewed by any of the group's members. <br /><br />When you first create a layout, only the creator of the layout is allowed to see it.  If the graph is publicly available on GraphSpace, then if the user shares the layout they created, the layout will also be made publicly available.  If the graph is privately shared, then if the user decides to share a layout they created, every group that has both the creater of the layout as well as the graph which the layout references will have access to that layout.
