<h1>Description of GraphSpace's Interface and Features</h1>

This page provides a detailed description of GraphSpace's features and how a user may interact with it in a browser. We document the REST API that allows <a href="#user_type">registered users</a> to programmatically interact with GraphSpace in the <a href="{{url}}help/programmers">Programmer's Guide</a>.

<h2 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>This section describes GraphSpace concepts and terms that are used throughout the documentation.
<hr>
<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="user_type">Anonymous vs. Registered user</h3>
<p>An <b>anonymous</b> user is anyone that is using GraphSpace without being logged in.  An anonymous user does not have access to the <a href="{{url}}help/programmers">REST API</a> and may not be a member of a <a href="{{url}}help#groups">group</a>.  Such a user may upload graphs anonymously <a href="{{url}}help#upload_graphs_cyjs">via a web interface</a>. We will delete graphs that are uploaded after <b>30 days</b>.</p>
<p>A <b>registered</b> user is anyone that is logged into GraphSpace.  By logging into GraphSpace, a user has full access to the <a href="{{url}}help/programmers">REST API</a> and is allowed to be a member of <a href="{{url}}help#groups">groups</a>.  Graphs uploaded by a registered user will remain in that user's account unless explicitly deleted by the user.   
<hr>

<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="public_private">Graph visibility: Private, Shared, or Public</h3>
<p>
  The visibility of a graph uploaded by a registered user can have one of three states: private, shared, or public. The visibility of a graph controls who can view the graph and interact with it upon visiting the URL associated with that graph.
  <dl>
    <dt>Private</dt>
    <dd>When a registered user uploads a graph to GraphSpace either through the <a href="{{url}}help/programmers#add_graph">REST API</a> or through the <a href="{{url}}graphs/upload">web interface</a>, its visibility is <b>private</b>, i.e., only the graph owner (the user who uploaded it) can view it. </dd>
    <dt>Shared</dt>
    <dd>A graph owner may <a href="#share">share a graph</a> with one or more <a href="#groups">groups</a>. At this point, the graph's visibility is <b>shared</b>, i.e., all members of these groups may view the graph.</dd>
    <dt>Public</dt>
    <dd>A graph owner may make the graph public through the <a href="{{url}}help/programmers/#make_graph_public">REST API</a>.</dd>
    
    </dl>
   If the owner of the graph is part of a group and shares their private graph with the group, all members of the group may view it as well as create their own layouts for the graph. (See <a href="#layout_panel">Layouts Panel</a>)</p>

<p>When an anonymous user uploads a graph, it is by default a <b>public</b> graph (See <a href="{{url}}help#upload_graphs_cyjs">uploading via web interface</a>).  A public graph is viewable to any person that visits GraphSpace.  

<p>In order to make a private graph uploaded by a registered user of GraphSpace public, it may be done so through the .  By making a graph public, it allows all registered users to share their layouts they create for the graph. (See <a href="#layout_panel">Layouts Panel</a>)</p> 

<hr>
<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="groups">Groups</h3>

A group is a collection of GraphSpace users.  For example, if there are multiple researchers who are collaborating a project, a group may be created containing all of them. Another use case for a group is for all students registered in a network biology course. Once a GraphSpace user becomes a member of a group, the user may <a href="#sharing_panel">share any graph that he/she owns</a> or a layout of such a graph with the group.  Only members of that group will be able to access the graph. A user may share a graph will multiple graphs. Conversely, a user may be a member of multiple groups but share a graph only with some of these groups.
</p>

A <b>group owner</b> is the creator of the group. Any GraphSpace user can create a group by visiting the <a href="{{url}}groups">Groups page</a> and clicking the "Create group" button. The group owner may
<ul>
  <li>Invite any GraphSpace user that has an account to be a member of their group.</li>
  <li>Remove any member from the group.</li>
  <li>Unshare any graph that has already been shared by the members of the group</li>
</ul>

A <b>group member</b> is a user who is a part of a group. (A group owner is trivially a member of the group.) A group member may
<ul>
  <li>Share a graph owned by him or her with a group.</li>
  <li>Unshare a previously shared graph.</li>
  <li>Share a layout for a previously shared graph.</li>
  <li>Unshare a previously shared layout.</li>
</ul>

The <a href="{{url}}groups">Groups page</a> provides access to all the groups owned by the user (by clicking the link "Owner of") as well as the groups of which the user is a member (via the link "Member of"). The user will have the option to delete a group (if the user wowns it) or to unfollow a group (if the user is a member).</p>

Clicking on the name of a group will open a new page that lists all the graphs in that group. This page will also contain a panels to search for nodes and edges in graphs belonging to that group and a panel to search for graphs in that group that match specific tags. If the user owns the group, there will be an interface to add or delete members. If the user is a member of group, the user can only see who are the other members of the group.

<b>Notes</b>:
<ul>
  <li>Users must have GraphSpace accounts and be logged in in order to access group functions.</li>
  <li>By design, groups are private, i.e., a GraphSpace user does not have access to the names of groups of which the user is not a member.</li>
  <li>GraphSpace does not have a mechanism wherein a user may request to become a member of a group. All memberships must be managed by private communication.</li>
</ul>


<hr>
<h2 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="upload_graphs">Upload graphs</h2>

<p>GraphSpace provides two methods to upload graphs: through the <a href="{{url}}help/programmers/#add_graph">REST API</a> or through the <a href="{{url}}graphs/upload">web interface</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="upload_graphs_rest">Via REST API</h3>
<p>This approach allows one to be more flexible and utilize all of the CSS features by specifically referencing them in the <a href="{{url}}help/programmers/#json_ref">JSON</a> for the graph. Please refer to the <a href="{{url}}help/programmers/">Programmer's Guide</a> for more information.</p>
<hr>
<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="upload_graphs_cyjs">Via Web Interface</h3>
<p>As an alternative to the <a href="{{url}}help/programmers/">REST API</a> for uploading a graph, we provide a simple web interface for <a href="{{url}}graphs/upload">uploading</a> individual graphs. We support the following types of graphs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graphs that follow the <a href="">GraphSpace JSON format</a>. As explained in the GraphSpace JSON reference, we have extended the JSON format used by <a href = "http://js.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape.js</a>. These files must use the <tt>.json</tt> extension.</li>
  <li>Graphs that a user of Cytoscape (v3.1 or later) can export into a different JSON format, which we call "cyjs". Please follow <a href="https://github.com/idekerlab/cy-net-share/wiki">these instructions</a> to export your Cytoscape graph to this format. These files must use the <tt>.cyjs</tt> extension. <b>Note: Files using the .cyjs format may only be uploaded via the web interface.</b></li>
</ul>


<p>If a user has an account and is logged in, this interface will upload the graph directly into the user's account, much like using the REST API. If a user does not have an account or is not logged in, this upload functionality will provide a unique URL through which the user may interact with the graph represented by the uploaded file. <b>Note: After 30 days, we will delete all graphs that are uploaded for unregistered users of GraphSpace.</b></p>

<hr>
<h2 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="view_graph">Interact with graphs</h2>

We will use the following public <a href="{{url}}graphs/craigy%40vt.edu/linker-q_0.5-query_CDC55-path_k_50/">graph</a> as a running example. When viewing a graph, you will notice several panels to the right.  Some of these panels may be closed.  Clicking on an individual panel will reveal information within it.


<br><br>
<img width="80%" height="500px" align="middle" src="../../static/images/public_graph.png">

<br><br>
<hr>
<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="embedded_info">Embedded Information</h3>
Elements (nodes and edges) inside of a graph may have information embedded in them.  Upon clicking any element inside of a graph, the element's border color will turn red.  If the clicked element contains information (see <a href="{{url}}help/programmers/#json_ref">JSON reference</a>), it will show up as part of a pop up box, otherwise no pop up will be shown. The image below shows the information that is contained inside of the node <b>CCT6</b>.
<br><br>
<img width="50%" height="400px" align="middle" src="../../static/images/node_info.png">
<br><br>
The information embedded inside elements may contain external links to sources as well.
<hr>
<!-- <h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="graph_panels">Graph Panels</h3> -->
<!-- <br><br> -->
<h3 style="padding-top: 60px; margin-top: -40px;" id="details_panel">Graph Details Panel</h3>

This panel contains information describing the graph, e.g., a legend.
<br><br>
<img src="../../static/images/gd_panel.png" style="width: 30%"></p>
<br>
<hr>

<h3 style="padding-top: 60px; margin-top: -40px;" id="search_panel">Search Panel</h3>

This panel provides an interface that allows the user to find nodes/edges that match search terms.  See <a href="{{url}}help#search_in_graph">Elements within a graph</a> for details on how to perform queries.
<br><br>
<img src="../../static/images/s_panel.png" style="width: 30%"></p>

</p>
If a user searches for an element and the element is found inside the graph, GraphSpace generates a link above the search bar.  This link provides a reference to this graph with all the nodes/edges matching the search terms highlighted. The user can share this URL with other GraphSpace users who can <a href="#groups">access this graph</a>. 
<hr>

<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="export_panel">Export Panel</h3>

Through this panel, a user can export an image of the current layout of the graph as a PNG file.  The JSON option allows a user to see the the JSON representation of the graph. 
<br>
<img src="../../static/images/e_panel.png" style="width: 30%"><br>
<hr>

<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="owner_panel">Owner Panel</h3>

This panel shows the GraphSpace user to whom the graph belongs.
<br>

<hr>

<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="sharing_panel">Sharing Panel</h3>

This panel displays all the groups with which the graph is shared.  If the user is the owner of the graph, the panel will also provide an interface to allow the user to share this graph with all the groups of which the user is a member.

Provides <a href="http://js.cytoscape.org/#layouts">multiple methods</a> to display or layout a graph.  <b>Note</b>: a user must have an account with GraphSpace in order to save and share layouts they create.
<br><br>
<p style="float: left; font-size: 9pt; text-align: center; width: 30%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;margin-left: 15%;">Auto Layouts<br><img src="../../static/images/layout_2.png" style="width: 90%"></p>

<p style="float: left; font-size: 9pt; text-align: center; width: 30%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Manual Layouts<br><img src="../../static/images/layout_panel.png" style="width: 90%"></p>
<p style="clear: both;"></p>
<br><br>
The 'Auto' option provides methods to automatically layout a graph using their respective <a href="http://js.cytoscape.org/#layouts">algorithms</a>. If a person has created an account and logged into GraphSpace, they they will be allowed to save any changes to the positions of elements in the graph that they manually make.  In addition, they will also be able to view layouts and share layouts with groups that they are a member of. [See <a href="#groups">Groups</a>]
<br><br>
If a user of GraphSpace saves their own layout, they are given the following functionalities for the layout through buttons presented in the following order:
(i) a direct link to this layout, (ii) change name of layout, (iii) share this layout with other users who have access to this graph, (iv) delete this layout, and (v) make it the default layout, i.e., instruct GraphSpace to display this layout whenever a user visits the page for this graph.
<br><br>

<br><br>

<hr>
<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="layout_editor">Layout Editor</h3>

GraphSpace provides tools for the selection and movement of multiple elements in the graph.  In order to do this, click the <b>Use Layout Editor</b> button.  

<br><br>
<img src="../../static/images/layout_editor.png" style="width: 25%"><br>

Clicking this button takes a user of GraphSpace to a simplified view of the graph.  From here, they may use the tool pallette provided to quickly re-arrange the structure of the graph.  The picture below shows the simplified version of the graph seen throguhout this guide.  Notice that labels for nodes are no longer shown and different options are provided to the user.  

<br><br>
<img width="80%" height="500px" align="middle" src="../../static/images/graph_layout_editor.png">
<br><br>

The <b>Start Tour</b> button walks a user through all of the features provided in the tool pallette.  The <b>Back to researcher view</b> button gives a user the option to save the current layout and/or go back to the original view of the current graph.  The <b>Select</b> section allows a user to choose elements in the graph based on their properties.  There are two properties from which a user can select elements: <b>Shape</b> and <b>Color</b>.

<br><br>
The <b>Shape</b> section allows a user to select all nodes that are any of the selected shapes.  For example, if a user wanted to select all nodes that are rectangle <b>OR</b> ellipses, they mark ellipse and rectangle under this section.

<br><br>
<img width="80%" height="500px" align="middle" src="../../static/images/graph_layout_editor2.png">
<br><br>

<br><br>
The <b>Color</b> section allows a user to select all nodes that are any of the selected colors.  For example, if a user wanted to select all nodes that are yellow <b>OR</b> green, they mark yellow and green under this section.

<br><br>
<img width="80%" height="500px" align="middle" src="../../static/images/graph_layout_editor3.png">
<br><br>

If a user wants to select all nodes that are rectangles <b>AND</b> are yellow, they would select rectangles from the Shape section and yellow from the Color section.

<br><br>
<img width="80%" height="500px" align="middle" src="../../static/images/graph_layout_editor4.png">
<br><br>

<br><br>
A user may click on the <b>Unselect All Nodes</b> button to reset all selections made.  There are also <b>Undo</b> and <b>Redo</b> buttons in case a user wants to repeat or undo their actions. 

<br><br>
The <b>Arrange</b> section allows a user to arrange all selected nodes into different shapes shown on the buttons. The following picture shows the arrangements of selected nodes that users may construct by clicking the buttons in this section.

<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="step_panel">Filter nodes and edges Panel</h3>

There are graphs in GraphSpace which employ the use of filtering nodes and edges.  This concept allows one to see subgraphs of the entire graph.  In addition, it allows a user to "step" through the connections of a graph in sequential order.  The images below show a user stepping through a graph.
<br><br>
<p style="float: left; font-size: 9pt; text-align: center; width: 30%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;margin-left: 15%;"><br><img src="../../static/images/step_1.png" style="width: 90%"></p>

<p style="float: left; font-size: 9pt; text-align: center; width: 20%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"<br><img src="../../static/images/filter_1.png" style="width: 90%"></p>
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<br><br>
<b>Current rank</b> reveals interactions (connections) that occur at a certain value.  For example, when <b>Current rank</b> was 10, the red node was revealed, however, when Number of highly probable paths was 8, it was hidden.
<br>
<br>
<b>Maximum rank</b> tells GraphSpace the maximum subgraph the user wants to see.  This is used to create a more sparce layouts for all nodes that a user wants to analyze.

<br>

<hr>
<h2 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="share">Share graphs</h2>
<p>Share graphs among members of <a href="#groups">groups</a>.  Sharing graphs with a group gives permission to all members of a group to see the graph.</p>
<hr>

<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="sharing_graphs">Sharing graphs with group(s)</h3>
<p>There are two ways to share a graph that a user owns: <a href='{{url}}help/programmers/#share_graph'>REST API</a> and <a href='{{url}}help/#sharing_panel'>Sharing Panel</a>.</p>

In order to share a graph, you must own the graph.  In addition, you must be a member or the owner of the group you want to share the graph with.  Sharing a graph allows all the members in the group to see the graph.  Un-sharing a graph means that no one else in the group is allowed to see that graph anymore.
<hr>
<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="sharing_layouts">Sharing layouts with group(s)</h3>

<p>Similar to a graph, a layout may also be shared with a group.  In order for a layout to be shared with a group, the graph (and implicitly the graph owner) must already be shared with a group.  It would make no sense to share a layout with a group if that graph may not be viewed by any of the group's members. <br /><br />When you first create a layout, only the creator of the layout is allowed to see it.  If the graph is publicly available on GraphSpace, then if the user shares the layout they created, the layout will also be made publicly available.  If the graph is privately shared, then if the user decides to share a layout they created, every group that has both the creator of the layout as well as the graph which the layout references will have access to that layout.</p>

<p>See <a href='{{url}}help/#layout_panel'>Layout Panel</a>.
<hr>
<h2 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="search">Search graphs</h2>

<p>The Search panel allows for any user of GraphSpace to search for elements and graphs that matches the criteria of ALL query terms.  A user may search for graphs using the name of a graph as well as a node or an edge which a graph may contain.</p>

<hr>
<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="search_semantics">Semantics</h3>
<p>GraphSpace supports the searching of <b>multiple queries</b>.  In order to search for multiple terms, simply seperate each search term with a ",".  For example: <tt>AKT1, AKT3, CTNNB1</tt>.</p>
<p>In order to search for an <b>edge</b>, use the following syntax [tail: head] where tail is the name of the source node and the head is the name of the target node.</p>
<p>In order to search for a <b>node</b>, simply enter the node's content. For example: AKT1</p>
<hr>
<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="search_in_graph">Elements within a graph</h3>
<p>GraphSpace allows a user to search for a nodes and edges that are inside a graph.  If a search term is found in the graph it is highlighted in the graph.  Multiple nodes and edges may be searched for within a graph by seperating each node/edge with a ",".

<br>
<p> For example, if a user searched for the node 'TEM1', then the node will look like this:</p><br>
<p style="float: left; font-size: 9pt; text-align: center; width: 30%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;margin-left: 15%;">TEM1 before searching<br><img src="../../static/images/before_searching.png" style="width: 50%"></p>

<p style="float: left; font-size: 9pt; text-align: center; width: 30%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">TEM1 after searching<br><img src="../../static/images/node_search.png" style="width: 50%"></p>
<p style="clear: both;"></p>

<br><br>

If a user wants to search for edge connection from TEF4 to TEM1, they can do so with the following search command: TEF4:TEM1.  The edge will look like this:
<br><br>

<p style="float: left; font-size: 9pt; text-align: center; width: 30%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;margin-left: 15%;">Before searching for edge<br><img src="../../static/images/before_edge.png" style="width: 60%"></p>

<p style="float: left; font-size: 9pt; text-align: center; width: 30%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">After searching for edge<br><img src="../../static/images/edge_search.png" style="width: 60%"></p>

The <b>Similar</b> option under the search bar allows one to search for all elements within a graph which may have the search term as part of its value.  For example, if there are two nodes CDC5 and CDC55 and the user does a similar search with the term 'CDC', then both CDC5 and CDC55 will be highlighted. 
<br><br>
The <b>Exact</b> option under the search bar allows one to search for all elements within a graph that are identical to the search term. If there are two terms CDC5 and CDC55 and the user does an exact search with the term 'CDC5', only CDC5 will be highlighted.  <b>Note</b>: If the user had searched for the term 'CDC', nothing would have been highlighted since there are no nodes in our example graph which have CDC as their entire value.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>:If there are mulitple search terms, all elements that are contained within the graph that is being searched on will be highlighted.</p>

The <b>Similar</b> option under the search bar allows one to search for all graphs that may contain that word in the graph itself.  This option will return all the graphs that may have a node which contains parts of the term(s) being searching, graphs that may contain part of the searched term in its name, as well as if there are edges which contain part of the searched term(s).
<br><br>
The <b>Exact</b> option under the search bar allows one to search for all graphs that have exactly what is being searched for.  Graphs returned from this option may have a node, graph name, or an edge which is identical to the searched term(s).
<br><br>
To search for graphs that match a graph name, simply type the name or a part of the name of the graph
<br><br>
To search for nodes, type the content inside of the node (text that is contained inside of a node)
<br><br>
To search for edges, search using the following syntax [tail: head] where tail is the name of the node where the arrow is coming from and head is the name of the node that the arrow is point to.  For example, to search for the edge that connects YEF3 to SIR2, type YEF3:SIR2.  All graphs that contain this edge will be presented to the user.  
<br><br>
If searching for multiple values, separate all individual search terms with commas.  Ex: AKT1, AKT3, JUN
<br><br>

<p><b>Note</b>:If there are multiple search terms (and/or tag terms), all graphs that are returned WILL match all of these terms.  All graphs that are returned by the searches of a node and/or an edge will have all searched terms highlighted inside the graph.</p>

<h3 style="padding-top: 50px; margin-top: -40px;" id="organize">Organize Graphs Using Tags</h3>

To aid the organization of graphs, GraphSpace uses the concept of tags. Each graph may have any number of tags. A tag is a useful mechanism for grouping a set of graphs, e.g., all the graphs that a user may desire to make public upon the publication of a paper. All tags associated with a graph must be defined in <a href="{{url}}help/programmers/#metadata">the metadata for the graph</a>. Hence, tags may be specified only when a user uploads graphs using the REST API.</p>

<p>A user can search for <a href="{{url}}">graphs</a> that match a tag. To search for multiple tags, simply separate them with commas.  Currently, the user must know the exact name of the tag.</p>

Note that tags provide a level of organization that are orthogonal to groups. Groups are intended to organize collaborating users of GraphSpace while tags are used to collect graphs.
