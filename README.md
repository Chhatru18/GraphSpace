GraphSpace 
================

IMMEDIATE TO DO'S
=======================
1) Completely revamp Help section

2) Figure out layout logic (possibly introduce another table for this)

3) Convert old db to new schema and update alter_table.py (a little more b/c of layout table)

4) Figure out how to render all the graphs with tags without slowing down too much

5) Fix the rest of the issues on github
