## EXAMPLE 1:

## AR: The examples in this main() function will bepart of the Programmer's Guide instead of here.  I have left it in for now for testing.
"""
Usage (from within the current directory)

This script posts two graphs.  The first graph reads 
in an edge file and modifies the attributes for each node and
each edge.  The second graph creates 10 random nodes and 20 
random undirected edges, using the default attributes from 
add_node() and add_edge() functions.

todo:: Currently, the example file is committed with this source code. Graphs are
posted to GraphSpace with Anna's username and password and shared with 
her group 'testgroup'.  This should be cleaned up.

todo:: need to make an OptionParser for this main function if we are 
going to keep it.  

todo:: raise exceptions for unexpected colors/widths/shapes/etc.
